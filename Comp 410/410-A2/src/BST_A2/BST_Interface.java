/*
  Interface: The BST will provide this collection of operations:

  insert:
    in: a string (the element to be stored into the tree)
    return: boolean, return true if insert is successful, false otherwise
    effect: if the string is already in the tree, then there is no change to
              the tree state, and return false
            if the string is not already in the tree, then a new tree cell/node
              is created, the string put into it as data, the new node is linked
              into the tree at the proper place; size is incremented by 1,
              and return a true
  remove:
    in: a string (the element to be taken out of the tree)
    return: boolean, return true if the remove is successful, false otherwise
            this means return false if the tree size is 0
    effect: if the element being looked for is in the tree, unlink the node containing
              it and return true (success); size decreases by one
            if the element being looked for is not in the tree, return false and
              make no change to the tree state
  contains:
    in: a string (the element to be seaarched for)
    return: boolean, return true if the string being looked for is in the tree;
            return false otherwise
            this means return false if tree size is 0
    effect: no change to the state of the tree

  findMin:
    in: none
    return: string, the element value from the tree that is smallest
    effect: no tree state change
    error: is tree size is 0, return null


  findMax:
    in: none
    return: string, the element value from the tree that is largest
    effect: no tree state change
    error: is tree size is 0, return null

  size:
    in: nothing
    return: number of elements stored in the tree
    effect: no change to tree state

  empty:
    in: nothing
    return: boolean, true if the tree has no elements in it, true if size is 0
            return false otherwise
    effect: no change to tree state

  height:
    in: none
    return: integer, the length of the longest path in the tree from root to a leaf
    effect: no change in tree state
    error: return -1 is tree is empty (size is 0, root is null)

  getRoot:
    in: none
    return: a tree cell/node, the one that is the root of the entire tree
            means return a null if the tree is empty
    effect: no change to tree state
