 /*
    Interface: A DIGRAPH will provide this collection of operations:

    addNode
      in: unique id number of the node (0 or greater)
          string for name
            you might want to generate the unique number automatically
            but this operation allows you to specify any integer
            both id number and label must be unique
      return: boolean
                returns false if node number is not unique, or less than 0
                returns false if label is not unique (or is null)
                returns true if node is successfully added 
    addEdge
      in: unique id number for the new edge, 
          label of source node,
          label of destination node,
          weight for new edge (use 1 by default)
          label for the new edge (allow null)
      return: boolean
                returns false if edge number is not unique or less than 0
                returns false if source node is not in graph
                returns false if destination node is not in graph
                returns false is there already is an edge between these 2 nodes
                returns true if edge is successfully added 
            
    delNode
      in: string 
            label for the node to remove
      out: boolean
             return false if the node does not exist
             return true if the node is found and successfully removed
    delEdge
      in: string label for source node
          string label for destination node
      out: boolean
             return false if the edge does not exist
             return true if the edge is found and successfully removed
    numNodes
      in: nothing
      return: integer 0 or greater
                reports how many nodes are in the graph
    numEdges
      in: nothing
      return: integer 0 or greater
                reports how many edges are in the graph
    topoSort:
      in: nothing
      return: array of node labels (strings)
                if there is no topo sort (a cycle) return null for the array
                if there is a topo sort, return an array containing the node
                  labels in order
                  
    shortestPath:
      in: string label for start vertex
      return: array of ShortestPathInfo objects (ShortestPathInfo)
              length of this array should be numNodes (as you will put in all shortest 
              paths including from source to itself)
              See ShortestPathInfo class for what each field of this object should contain
